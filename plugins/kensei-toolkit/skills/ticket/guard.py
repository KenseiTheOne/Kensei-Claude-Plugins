"""ticket guard — PreToolUse hook registered by the /kensei-toolkit:ticket skill.

Blocks, in code, what the skill may only do on the user's explicit command:

  commit       git commit / merge / rebase / cherry-pick / revert / am (history-writing) other
               than the two below — including a commit on a base branch the session was already
               on (the user chose to work there)
  merge-local  a local git merge / rebase that integrates into a base branch: run while a base
               branch is checked out, after `git switch <base>` in the same command, or
               `git rebase <upstream> <base>`; and any history write (cherry-pick, am, commit)
               after `git switch <base>` in the same command; `git commit` concluding a merge
               on a base branch; `git fetch . <branch>:<base>`. Bringing a base branch up to date
               from its own remote branch (`git merge --ff-only origin/main` on main) is history;
               a rebase of the base branch's own commits (`git rebase -i HEAD~3`) is commit
  base-sync    a git merge / rebase / pull of a base branch into the task branch (`git merge
               main`, `git rebase --onto origin/main …`, `git pull origin main`) — allowed under
               commit or merge-local; it uses
               up the commit command only when no merge-local command is open
  push         git push to a non-base branch (a plain `git push` / `git push <remote>` is judged by
               where the repository's settings send it: remote.<r>.push, push.default with
               branch.<b>.merge — upstream / simple / tracking to the upstream, matching to
               every branch — so a base branch there is force), git send-email / send-pack, gh repo
               sync, gh pr update-branch (force with --force / --rebase), any gh call with --push,
               GitHub/GitLab/GitKraken MCP file/branch pushes
  publish      creating something public outside the task branch, one grant per object — a
               release (gh release create / upload / edit, gh api writes to …/releases), a gist
               (gh gist create / edit, gh api …/gists), a repository (gh repo create / fork,
               gh api POST …/repos or …/forks); and the same through a GitHub MCP. A grant for
               one object does not reach another: «создай репо» is no release
  repo-admin   changing an existing repository, its secrets or CI, one grant per kind:
               settings (gh repo edit incl. --visibility / rename / archive / unarchive /
               autolink, gh api PATCH repos/o/r, hooks, collaborators, pages, topics, graphql
               updateRepository), secrets (gh secret / variable / deploy-key / ssh-key / gpg-key,
               …/secrets, …/variables, …/environments, …/keys, user/keys), ci (gh workflow / run /
               cache, …/actions, …/dispatches, …/deployments), protection (gh ruleset, …/rulesets,
               …/branches/<b>/protection, tags/protection), delete (gh release delete /
               delete-asset, gh gist delete); org endpoints and full api URLs alike; the same
               through a GitHub MCP. «поставь секрет» is no visibility change. gh repo delete and
               MCP repository deletes are destructive
  pr           opening a PR / MR (gh pr create, create_pull_request, api POST …/pulls)
  pr-body      a PR body that is not this session's approved <run_dir>/PR-BODY.md — on gh pr
               create, gh pr edit --body / --body-file, api …/pulls with body=, GraphQL
               createPullRequest / updatePullRequest, a GitHub / GitLab MCP PR create or update.
               The body passes when it is that file (--body-file, also after a `cd` in the same
               command; `--body "$(cat <file>)"`; gh api `-F body=@<file>`, GraphQL `body: $body`
               with `-F body=@<file>`) or text equal to it byte for byte, trailing line breaks
               aside; --web leaves it to the user. The file is the approved one only while its
               sha256 equals the last `pr_body_sha256:` in RUN.md (recorded when the user approved
               it) and the same command cannot write PR-BODY.md or RUN.md: it holds nothing but
               plain reads, git and gh — no redirect into a name built at run time (`> $P`,
               `PR-BODY.{md,x}`), no cp / tee / script / function. A body in a nested field
               (`-F input[body]=…`, JSON --input variables) cannot be checked. No tag grants
               another text: it is approved first
  merge        merging a PR / MR (gh pr merge, merge_pull_request, api …/merge, GraphQL
               mergePullRequest / enablePullRequestAutoMerge)
  force        a push that rewrites, deletes or widens: --force*, -f in any bundle (-fu),
               --delete, --mirror, --all, --tags, +refspec; or one to a base branch — main,
               master, develop, production, …, the remote's default branch, the `base_branch:`
               of this session's RUN.md, or the current branch when none is named
  branch-delete  git branch -d / -D / --delete («удали ветку», "delete the branch", [delete-branch]
               or [reset]); it grants no reset, clean or worktree remove. A remote branch delete
               (push --delete, :ref) stays force
  history      git pull, reset --hard/--soft or to a ref, update-ref, branch -f/-M/-C, checkout -B,
               switch -C, filter-branch/-repo, stash pop/apply/drop; and throwing local changes
               away: clean -f, checkout/restore of paths, checkout/switch --force, worktree remove
               --force
  status       a change of the status field only: an MCP update, transition or close / reopen
               tool whose only changed key is the status (state, transition), gh issue close /
               reopen. A typed command that names tasks covers exactly those tasks, each once
               (the call's task id, issue number or key matched against the ids and link
               segments typed); naming none, or an option's [status], covers one change
  create-task  creating a task / issue (clickup_create_task, create_issue, gh issue create, an
               operator create on a task model); one command covers the whole batch
  tracker      any other tracker write (MCP tool, clickup_execute_operator write pairs, gh issue /
               pr / label / project edits, curl/wget/httpie writes to a tracker) — including an
               update or transition that changes the status together with other fields
  destructive  deleting a task / issue / page, merging tasks
  delete       deleting a tracker comment
  comment      posting or editing a tracker comment — only text the user approved word for word
  send         a message that leaves through mail, chat or a calendar: a mail / chat / calendar
               MCP server's send, reply, forward, post, reaction, invite or respond, a chat
               message or canvas edit, any calendar event write (Gmail send_message / reply /
               forward / send_draft, Slack post / reply / canvas, Calendar create / update /
               delete / respond_to_event); and on any other non-tracker server, a tool named for
               sending mail or a message (send / reply / forward with mail / email / message /
               sms: outlook_email_send, send-mail, send_gmail_message) or for writing an event
               (create / update / delete / respond with event / meeting / calendar). Drafts and
               reads pass (`get_post`); a Slack send_message_draft counts as a send. Server names
               that also mean something else (signal, sms, zoom, teams, exchange) count only as
               the whole server name. curl / wget / httpie POSTs to webhooks
               (hooks.slack.com, discord.com/api/webhooks, *.webhook.office.com, Telegram bots,
               …). One command, one message
  tamper       writing to this session's transcript, the guard's markers, the guard's own files
               or plugin install, or hook settings (a Bash write to a settings*.json; a Write/Edit
               that changes hooks, disableAllHooks, enabledPlugins or allowManagedHooksOnly, the
               file compared as JSON before and after; `claude plugin disable`), or git settings
               that redirect a push, redefine a git word or run a program (`git config` writes of
               remote.*, branch.*.merge / remote / pushRemote, alias.*, core.hooksPath /
               editor / sshCommand / fsmonitor, sequence.editor, include.* / includeIf.*, url.*,
               push.default, filter / diff / merge drivers; `git remote add` / `set-url` /
               `rename` / `set-head`; and the same as a file write — Write / Edit, a redirect,
               tee, cp, PowerShell Set-Content / Add-Content / Out-File — to .git/config, any
               worktree's or submodule's config, .git/hooks/* or core.hooksPath, .git/info/
               attributes, ~/.gitconfig, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config, gh's config.yml; a
               .gitattributes or global attributes write that names a filter / diff / merge
               driver other than lfs and the built-in merge drivers, or copies one in; a link made
               to .git, .claude or a protected path; `gh alias set` naming a gated write, `gh
               alias import`; a write git itself makes at a path an option or a patch names —
               checkout-index --prefix (each tracked file under it), archive -o, diff / log
               --output, format-patch -o, bundle create, the paths of a readable apply / am patch
               under --directory with -p, a .gitattributes driver in one; tar -x of a readable
               archive's members, or of a `git archive --prefix=…` piped into it) — never
               allowed. Paths are compared without case, as macOS and Windows file systems do
               (`.GIT/config` is `.git/config`).
               A settings file is any settings*.json in the config dir ($CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or
               ~/.claude) or in a `.claude` dir, or managed-settings.json, matched on the path as
               written and on its realpath (a symlink to dotfiles is still the settings);
               reading them is fine. The guard's own files are the copy that runs: with
               `--plugin-dir` on a dev clone, a /ticket session cannot edit that clone's
               skills/ticket/ or hooks/ (deliberate — the session would be editing its own
               guard); develop the plugin with /ticket from the installed copy instead
  opaque       a command the guard cannot read: a program named by $VAR or $(…) that plausibly
               is git (its name says git; or it names no other tool and its first argument is
               a writing git subcommand; a literal basename after it, `$ROOT/gradlew`, decides), a
               git subcommand built from $VAR or $(…) (`git $S origin`), runner targets named
               exactly push / publish / release / deploy / ship (`make push`, `npm run release`),
               a `git -c` / --config-env of a setting that runs a program, defines an alias or
               changes a remote (core.editor / sshCommand / fsmonitor / hooksPath / pager,
               sequence.editor, alias.*, remote.*, url.*, include*, credential helpers, diff /
               merge / filter drivers, …; a plain pager or editor name passes, as in the
               environment), one of branch.* / push.default before a push; `git --exec-path=…`;
               GIT_CONFIG_* (but GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL/SYSTEM=/dev/null, GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM),
               GIT_SSH_COMMAND, GIT_EDITOR, GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR, GIT_PAGER, EDITOR, … set before git
               or exported earlier in the command (a plain editor or pager name passes); a git or
               gh write that git runs for itself — rebase -x, bisect run, submodule foreach,
               filter-branch --*-filter, filter-repo callbacks, difftool / mergetool -x, grep -O,
               --upload-pack / --receive-pack — or that xargs,
               parallel, find -exec, fd -x run once per input; in PowerShell, Invoke-Expression
               of a built string (`iex $cmd`, `iex ('git ' + 'push')`), an encoded command (pwsh
               -EncodedCommand / -enc / -e, from Bash too), a call `&` / dot-source `.` (with or
               without a space: `&'git'`, `&("git")`, `.( … )`) of a name that is not a literal —
               `& "gi$('t')"`, `&("gi"+"t")`, `& $g` — unless it plainly names another tool, and a
               `$var` / `(…)` program that may be git (`&("{0}{1}" -f …)`, `&(Get-Command gi*)`),
               `git @args`, git after `$env:` / Set-Item env: / [Environment]::
               SetEnvironmentVariable or a cmd `set` of a setting as above (names without case, as
               Windows reads them; HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME and USERPROFILE move the global config);
               a git write at a path built at run time, apply / am --directory outside the
               repository, --unsafe-paths with a patch from stdin, a patch it cannot open; a gh
               word it does not know while the command sets GH_CONFIG_DIR / XDG_CONFIG_HOME (Bash,
               export, env, $env:, cmd set) to a config.yml it cannot read or without that alias
               — one it reads gives the alias; a GraphQL request whose query is not
               read (a variable, a substitution, a missing @file or --input, a curl body that is
               not literal JSON) — never allowed. A shell named by
               $VAR (`$SHELL -c "…"`) is read like `sh -c`; `pwsh -c "…"` from Bash like PowerShell
  skill-post   a skill told to post (/code-review --comment, --post) — never allowed
  delegate     SendMessage — the user confirms it (permissionDecision "ask")
  schedule     RemoteTrigger (other than list / get / list_runs / get_run_log) and CronCreate: work
               that runs later or in the cloud, outside this guard — the user confirms it ("ask");
               subagents are refused
  stash        git stash push — subagents only; the orchestrator stashes on the Step 5 answer

The PowerShell tool is read like Bash where it can be: git and gh words in each statement (call
operators, `git.exe`, `& (Get-Command git)`, backtick escapes undone; a script block `&{…}`,
`.{…}`, `{ … }`, `@(…)`, `[void](…)` and `$(…)`, also inside "…", read as statements),
Start-Process arguments ('push','origin', @('push'), -FilePath git.exe -ArgumentList 'push
origin'), what a literal
Invoke-Expression / cmd /c string carries, Invoke-WebRequest / Invoke-RestMethod / curl.exe
writes, and writes to protected paths — in order after Set-Location / cd, Copy-Item / Move-Item
into a directory as DIR/<name>, [IO.File]::Write* / Copy / Move, a `$p = '…'` literal read where
$p is used. A failed PowerShell call uses its command up.

A command comes from the session transcript, read back to the latest message the user typed
(origin.kind == "human"). A message the user queued while the model was busy adds its orders to
the message before it, where it arrived — unless it holds back: a stop word («стоп», «подожди»,
«не сейчас», wait), a negated, cancelled or deferred gated action («не коммить пока», «пуш
позже», «отмена»), or a change of plan whatever it names («передумал», «я сам закоммичу»,
«сначала …», "first …", «перед этим», «дай посмотреть», «не надо», "let me see"). That voids
every command given so far, and the message itself grants nothing. Taking the step over is read
in the first person only: «я сам», «сам запушу», "I'll do it" revoke; «сделай сам» / «давай сам»
(the model is told to do it) do not. A negation about anything
else («тесты не трогай») voids nothing.

  typed text     conservative: imperatives such as «закоммить», «запушь», «залей ветку»,
                 «переведи в ревью» (status), «создай задачу» (create-task), «удали ветку»
                 (branch-delete; "pull the latest" orders nothing), «залейся в мейн» /
                 «смерджи в мейн» (commit + merge-local; «залей» also the push to the base
                 branch); negation scoped to its list item, conditional or cancelled sentences
                 dropped.
                 A question («почему git push упал?», "commit?") orders nothing unless it is an
                 imperative or a polite request («закоммить?», «можешь закоммитить?», "could you
                 push it?"). A git/gh command counts only as the whole item, never mentioned
                 inside a sentence; pasted text — fenced blocks, `>` lines, the middle of a long
                 message (only the first and last 4 KB are read), a quotation (paired quotes,
                 single ones included, after «говорит», «написано», «сказано», "says"; double
                 quotes after a colon: «тикет говорит: «запушь»») — never counts. English verbs need a git object: "revert that
                 commit", "push to github", "commit with message …", not "revert these
                 functions". A status command covers the tasks it names, each once («переведи
                 86abc1 и 86abc2 в ревью» is those two; a PR or commit link, «PR #45» is no
                 task); naming none, one change. A message to a chat or mail needs somewhere to
                 go («отправь сообщение», «напиши в слак», «отправь письмо»), an event the
                 calendar («создай событие в календаре», «назначь встречу») — «напиши сообщение
                 коммита» and «добавь событие в лог» are no send. «обнови описание PR» / "update
                 the PR description" is a tracker edit.
  AskUserQuestion answers after that message: an option the user picked grants exactly the tags
                 in its label — [commit] [merge-local] [push] [pr] [merge] [force-push]
                 [publish] [repo-admin] [reset] [delete-branch] [status] [create-task] [tracker-edit]
                 [delete-task] [delete-comment] [send]; [publish] grants the object its label names
                 (релиз / release, репо / repo, гист / gist) and [repo-admin] the kind its label
                 names (visibility / rename / archive, секрет / variable, workflow / CI, защита /
                 ruleset, удалить релиз / гист) — nothing when it names none; [post]
                 approves the option's `preview` as the comment text, if the preview was shown
                 in full

A command is used up by the call it authorized: one commit, one push, one status write — and one
call may not carry the same action twice. A create-task command is the exception: it covers every
task of the batch it was given for, until the user's next message. A call the user rejected uses nothing up, nor does one
that failed (is_error: a non-zero exit, a rejected push, a commit a hook refused) — for a shell
command only when the failure is the gated step's own: one command, or an `&&` chain ending in
it. In `git push; false` or `git push && npm test` the push may have happened, so it is used
up. An MCP call that failed is used up unless the head of its error plainly refuses it (a
validation error, invalid params / -32602, a 4xx code, "not found"): after a timeout or an
unclear error the write may have landed, and it is not repeated blind. A comment text that was posted cannot be posted again;
every text field of the call must be the approved text.
When the model invoked /ticket itself, what the user typed before that does not count.

Two registrations, because a skill's frontmatter hooks do not reach its subagents (measured):

  guard.py --main      SKILL.md frontmatter; the main session once /ticket is invoked. Marks the
                       session as a ticket session, then checks the command.
  guard.py --subagent  plugin hooks/hooks.json via hooks/subagent-guard.sh, which runs this only
                       for subagent calls (`agent_id` set) in a marked session. Subagents are
                       refused every gated action — only the orchestrator commits, pushes or
                       writes to the tracker.
  guard.py --post      SKILL.md frontmatter, PostToolUse; only notes this session's run (below).

This session's run is the run directory whose RUN.md the main session last wrote (Write / Edit,
a shell redirect into it, or a PowerShell Set-Content / Out-File / redirect), noted by
`guard.py --post` once the call has run; the marker keeps it. Only its `base_branch:` joins the base branches, and only its PR-BODY.md is an approved PR
body; before the session writes a RUN.md there is none, and another task's RUN.md in the
same repository never counts.

Output: nothing when the call is not gated or is authorized — the normal permission flow
continues, the hook never grants anything. A JSON "deny" with the reason otherwise ("ask" for
SendMessage, RemoteTrigger and CronCreate in the main session). Internal errors fail closed for calls that look gated.

Known gaps, where the skill's text rules alone apply: git run from a script or an interpreter
(`sh ./x.sh`, `python -c`, a .ps1), the browser, a child `claude` session, tracker CLIs other
than gh, git settings exported by an earlier command, a patch fed to git apply / am on stdin,
a tar archive from stdin or one tarfile cannot list, a git archive written earlier in the same
command included (only -C .git/hooks is tamper; .git and ~/.claude pass), a tar's attached
-C<dir>, name rewriting (--transform, --xform, -s) or run in a subshell after cd ((cd .git &&
tar -x), sh -c), any tar in PowerShell (no tar check there), other extractors and patch(1)
(unzip, Expand-Archive, python -m tarfile, busybox tar, pax), git merge-file (its first path
gets no protected-path check, only the PR-write one), globs in a target path (.git/conf*),
PowerShell env writes the regex misses (-Value or -Force before -Path, New-Item -Name X -Path
env:, an Environment:: or computed env: path, Copy-Item / Rename-Item into env:, Set-Location
env:, Start-Process -Environment), GH_CONFIG_DIR set for a nested shell (X=… bash -c, cmd /c
"set X=… & gh") or by readonly / eval / read, HOME / $env:AppData / $env:USERPROFILE moving gh's
config (HOME only makes git opaque), a git alias for checkout-index / archive / apply in the
tamper check, a gh config.yml
that exists and is rewritten in the same command (read as it was), mailbox housekeeping
(labels, trash), a
PowerShell variable set other than by a literal in the same command (judged by name), reported
speech without quotes («тикет говорит: запушь» is read as an order). PR-BODY.md is approved by
its hash in RUN.md: the guard trusts that `pr_body_sha256:` was written when the user approved
the text shown at the gate. A cancel word drops the sentence
(«отмени встречу», "cancel the meeting" grant nothing; a [send] option does). A typed status
command allows any status change of a named task, closing the issue included — the guard cannot
see the target status. A typed «сначала прогони тесты, потом закоммить» grants the commit at
once — the order rests on the skill text.
Skill-frontmatter hooks do not come back in a resumed session (`claude --resume`, measured on
2.1.286) until the skill is invoked again: `--main` and `--post` are off until then; the plugin
hooks.json wrapper does not depend on the skill (by design, not measured after a resume).
The transcript fields read here (origin.kind, queued_command attachments, toolUseResult,
is_error) were checked against Claude Code 2.1.286 (testdata/transcript-2.1.286.jsonl);
task-notification queued_command entries there also carry `renderedInHumanTurn`, which is not
read — their origin is not human. ClickUp operators are judged by their names' words: the live
catalogue had none enabled (testdata/clickup-operators.json).
